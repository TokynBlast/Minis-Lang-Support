# Minis Language Support

Provides syntax highlighting for the **Minis (.mi)** programming language.<br>
This programming language is incomplete. You can view it [here](https://github.com/TokynBlast/minis/tree/boot-strap)<br>
The boot strap branch is the one in current development. Tokenize was previously in development but eventually ditched.

This is to help mainly, with writing the compiler, and is for the developer of the language.<br>
The actual language isn't complete yet and some key words are only for place holders.<br>
Such as the with {} and {} statements. They used to be used for threading.<br>
Threading was then moved to a standard library and they were no longer needed.<br>
But, I still want to find some way to use it.

Enjoy Minis! 😊
